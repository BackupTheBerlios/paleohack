The Hack 1.0.3 license:

  Unchanged source and source changed to adapt the game to a changing
  environment (operating system, libraries, compiler) may be freely
  distributed.

This is the only license under which PaleoHack can be distributed!

The license can't be changed for any part of the original Hack code!
So I can't grant permission for you to make a variant of Hack.

However, I will let anyone reuse any PalmOS-specific part of the code
that _I_ wrote, under the MIT/BSD/X11 licenses.  If you are porting
something else to PalmOS, that is probably the only part of the code
you would be interested in anyway.

If you have any questions about this, just ask me.
